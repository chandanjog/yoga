        ::icon(fa fa-book)
          visualize devi stroking your forehead - giving sadbuddhi
          make notes of unresolved thoughts, todo lists, finish the story
        2.Attention on muladhar, Turiyatita - 10 mins
            Hold lotus bud mudra
            Loose inteterst in everything
            eyes closed, not interested in anything

            You can deal with karma at beeja and vipaka before you have to eat it.
                Turiyatita show what you can deal with now
                    Think our way out!! - take 2 days off, don't indulge in low value useless activitis, addictions, self pity
                    As Siddhas we do better
                    karma is exactly what we asked for! - amazon generation, money comes from other peoples bank account while people pleasing god
                Thinking, Communication, Character - is an algorithm, logic gates    
                    How do you respond - with addiction, neighbour not pleasanat with you, no genuine care in relationships, job is overwhelming no time for anything etc
                    Find the true cause
                        whats the range of things they can say
                        they have concluded you don't care, associating with you is toxic
                        don't go in victim hood, not looking for solutions, lost faith in DEVI
