        1.Start with 108 Navarna mantra recitation - om aim hrim klim chamundaye viche
        ::icon(fa fa-book)
          visualize devi stroking your forehead - giving sadbuddhi
          make notes of unresolved thoughts, todo lists, finish the story
        2.Attention on muladhar, Turiyatita - 10 mins
            Hold lotus bud mudra
            Loose inteterst in everything
            eyes closed, not interested in anything
            Breathe quitely through the nose, increases energy!
            come out - start becoming aware of things, born again

        3.Turiya meditation at your navel
            feel a sense of dharma, sense of purpose
            stick out your little finger in the lotus bud
                exchaning energy, helping navel
            knowing, there is outside world and outside
            sense of self
            nourishment coming from navel, of embryo, oxygen, prana
            breath out and hold it for a few seconds
                lazy
                feels a lot of activity at the navel, still draws prana
                make sure don't go out of breath
                not a game of how long can i hold my breath,
                    inner being get nourished when you hold your breath
                very healling for body
                minutely notice OM vibration in navel - very faint
                    hear when you hold your breath out
                    will protect you from blue light and EMF radation
                        will convert everything to nourishment
                        will increase pure mitochondrial water in the body
        4.Sushupti
            release one more finger
            same breathing
            start hearing vibration in the heart
                pure joy - beauty of the mind, beauty of the body is proportions
                environment that supports it!
            there is also a deep sense of turiya tita here as well
                its presence in turiya as well, it's wick runs through jagrut and all of them                         
            rest to the body when you hold it out
            mudra helps to draw in prana    
        
        5.Swapna - focus on your throat
            breath however it come, - no kumbhaka, bhaer vs anter kubhaka, holding breath inwards vs outwards 
            mudra - three fingers out, other two as arrow
            dream of a time when you have no problems and no limitations!
                what would you be?
                what if people around you became capable of removing all problems?
                how will the bodies be of people in your story/journey be?
                stimulate the dream
                gentle rocking is okay!
                build this connection of nadis, as prana flows you will be able to dream
                in swapna I am always at the court of devi watching her
                    do all my actions as if I am in the court of devi
                    she can give many assigments
                    a sense of dharma will build if you think like this

                            eg: life like rajnikant movie
                                make them concious beings
                                    win for me is to be the hero of movie, reliable, resourceful, positive, astute
                                    divine court of raj rajeshwari, the queen of queens, bhavani, maha bhandarika, lalitha, kamehshwara and kameshwari, she sits on him

        6.Jagrut 
            mudra - arrow mudra fold other fingers, pleases devi
            foucus on 3rd eye, taking information, fully awake, not meditating on anything
            waking dream, words to make it happen

                    telling her, with limited body i can care about is this earth and being associated with it
                        she said - who is not associate with the earth? why do you think all the spirituality happens on earth? its my favourite?
