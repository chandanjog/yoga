      root((Day 2 - Life agenda))
        1.Start with 108 Navarna mantra recitation - om aim hrim klim chamundaye viche
        ::icon(fa fa-book)
          visualize devi stroking your forehead - giving sadbuddhi
          make notes of unresolved thoughts, todo lists, finish the story
        2.Attention on muladhar, Turiyatita - 10 mins
            Hold lotus bud mudra
            Loose inteterst in everything
            eyes closed, not interested in anything
            Breathe quitely through the nose
        3.End of the Day, when Sun goes down
            Offer Sandhya prayers to devi, ask power to plan new day, no loose ends     
            No spirituality possible in ill health and poverty!
            When no thoughts come
                You realize you are at the beginning of the creation of universe
                It needs to get created every moment from Turiyatita
                God is a deep nothing
                    Cannot be detected by senses, Nirgun Brahman, formless God
                    para para, transcends the transcendental
                Truth is emptyness, everything is an illusion
                    Lies vs illusion
                        lies are deliberate miscreation of truth usually for ignoble ends
                    Illusion is a necessary truth of not oneness
                        Urge will then rise to create a universe
                            Creates a steward for that urge, formless shakti - mahamaya
                                it comes out of formless nameless one
                                    like voldermot - nobody can speak of
                                    so swami nisargananda said - I am that only
                            From her comes everything else - sargas, visargas, brahma, vishnu, mahesh, all gods/goddesses, rishis
                                Some things are created by brahma, other's by vishnu
                                Also shiva
                                    No good at it, When brahma asked him to create, He created 11 rudras; just like him
                                There are 50 crore planets across the universe
                                    Some are occupied by only ganpati, other by only shiva
                                    Our planet is unique, no two things are alike                                     
                                        This is a world where each one creates an entire universe from themselves
                                            What's the health of that universe
                                                paramhans nityanada says - me and me talking to me = same, 
                                                so called external world is also you
                                                    everything is my projection on them
                                                        that's how they will behave with me
                                                        If you haven't bothered to create that - there will be random things as you have not been concisous
                                                            Thinking time different than meditation time
                                                            We have karma to be elite siddhas
                                                                having karmas does not mean it will happen, you can interfere in various ways
                                                                    do karma visarjana
                                                                whats a real win
                                                                    abraham maslow - great psychologist, investigator of motivations
                                                                        hierarchy of needs - in yoga, library of wins
                                                                            base - air, food, water, shelter, clothes, sex.. basic needs
                                                                            self esteem needs - who I am??
                                                                                Define yourself as having karma to be a mahasiddha in this lifetime
                                                                                    every action changes
        4.Who am I?? - 10 mins on swadishthana
            see and feel everything that comes, truth about you right now
            might not be flattering truth, maybe miserable truth, that's good, huge win to improve yourself                                                                            this information is swadishthana, two fingers above muladhara
            Dont visualize anything, whatever visions come let them be, no distractions that are written down
            pray to devi to know who you are?
                All characteristics you have assigned are sitting there - both good and ugly
                It's a Grand illusion
                    you have choice to be whatever you want in this story of your life
                    be in adbhuta rasa, it will become more beautiful overnight  
                    decide your story, what kind of person you have to be to be the hero\
                    no victims are welcome, respectful but cold treatment
                        no help for victims, not ready to learn
                        don't teach villans - evil things in the world are enemies, respect more that victims    
                    giving grace to focus on swadishthana
                        whats allowed emotinally for this character, whining and crying is not allowed
                        no matter how bad the situation is, hero alwys looking to solve it and come victorious
                            hero has library of wins, not unidimensional win, not only money, 
                                what will you do with it if you had all the money in the world?
                                    if you haven't thought about it you will die
                                        body has nothing to get ready for, no destination it will rust
                                            car that is abondoned in garage, it become junk, rusts, needs to be recycled   
                                        guruji destination is to be a guru since age 8, no contradiction

                                            never too late
                                            why not translate the vedas, nobody is teaching it in school, 
                                            so much knowledge came, when you read puranas you don't realize how complicated the universe is
                                                made head spin when reading tantras, shiva breaks it down    
                                            here to do something very complext, made learning this my business, learn about the human mind
                                            this vehicle/form is not an accident
                                                you earned it, went through many yonis eg: being a cat 13 years limite
                                                humans, if not given a purpose more than 100 yrs will start decaying and die
